## Outdated Packages (as of June 2026)
The following packages have newer major versions available but are NOT updated to avoid breaking changes:

| Package | Current | Latest | Reason for Not Updating |
|---------|---------|--------|------------------------|
| react | 18.3.1 | 19.x | React 19 has breaking API changes. Wait for ecosystem compatibility. |
| react-dom | 18.3.1 | 19.x | Must match react version. |
| react-router-dom | 6.30.4 | 7.x | v7 has breaking route API changes. Requires migration effort. |
| tailwindcss | 3.4.19 | 4.x | Tailwind v4 has completely new config system. Major refactor needed. |
| vite | 6.4.3 | 8.x | Vite 8 has breaking plugin API changes. |
| @vitejs/plugin-react | 4.7.0 | 6.x | Must match vite version compatibility. |

**Recommended action:** Keep current versions stable. Schedule major version upgrades as a separate task with proper testing.
